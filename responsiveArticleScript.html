        Long time ago, in a tiny town near the coastline
        in West Sumatera, lived a female and her son,
        Malin Kundang. Malin Kundang’s papa had actually
        died when he was a child, as well as he had to
        live tough with his mom. Malin Kundang was a
        healthy, diligent, and also strong kid. He generally
        went to the sea to capture fish, as well as brought
        it to his mommy, or offered it in the community.

        One day, when Malin Kundang was cruising customarily,
         he saw a vendor’s ship which was being raided by a
         tiny band of pirates. With his take on and also
         power, Malin Kundang beat the pirates. The merchant
         was so happy and also asked Malin Kundang to cruise
        with him. Malin Kundang agreed.

        Several years later on, Malin Kundang ended up being
        a wealthy seller, with a substantial ship, lots of
        trading goods, numerous ship crews, as well as a
        beautiful wife. In his journey, his ship arrived
        on a coastline. The citizens recognized him, and
        the news ran quick in the community: Malin Kundang
        came to be an abundant male and now he is right here.
        His mother, in deepful sadnees after years of
        isolation, ran to the beach to fulfill her precious
        boy once again.
